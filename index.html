        <img src="assets/img/about-me.jpg" alt="">
        <p>I like people. I like music. I like fun. I don't do boring. I am a simple man who is easily amused. The world is my playground. The Internet is my sandbox. I use it to work, to play, to learn, and to connect. I try to bring that out in my work. The web should reflect the world around us, not just the one in our screens.</p>
        <p>I am but a humble developer and designer. Always learning, and always with the zeal and enthusiasm of a pupil eager to further develop his craft. I will never claim to know it all (and am wary of those who do), but I will never back down from a challenge; the proverbial comfort zone scares me more than the unknown. And to be honest, anyone who doesn't share that fear with me doesn't stick around for long.</p>
        <p>So let's talk and make something. Let's push comfort zones. Let's reflect the world around us.</p>
